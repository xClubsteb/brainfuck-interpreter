This repository is my attempt at writing brainfuck interpreters in different languages.

# Brainfuck

[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Swiss student Urban MÃ¼ller. Designed to be extremely minimalistic, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer, and an instruction pointer.
